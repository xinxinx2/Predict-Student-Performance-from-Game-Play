We train GroupKFold models for each of the 18 questions. Our CV score is 0.664. We infer test using one of our KFold models. We can improve our CV and LB by engineering more features for our random forest and/or trying different models (like other ML models and/or RNN and/or Transformer). Also we can improve our LB by using more KFold models OR training one model using all data (and the hyperparameters that we found from our KFold cross validation)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6a6bf827-c964-478e-a58e-10a77547ac24","_uuid":"1be4af52-a1d5-44e8-856d-f7e83fc73dc5","collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-23T02:57:21.865523Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-23T02:57:21.864931Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-23T02:57:23.192076Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-23T02:57:23.191304Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-23T02:57:21.865445Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"papermill":{"duration":1.027875,"end_time":"2023-02-07T00:59:59.180261","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-07T00:59:58.152386","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd, numpy as np\n","from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, GroupKFold\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\n","import gc\n","import random\n","from tqdm import tqdm"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"09d1455e-5b36-4ef4-9a36-7e71edb9b03a","_uuid":"bf6b0c16-62d0-4d50-8bd9-93a98425dcd4","papermill":{"duration":0.004542,"end_time":"2023-02-07T00:59:59.189777","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-07T00:59:59.185235","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"source":["# Load Train Data and Labels"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-23T02:57:27.844693Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-23T02:57:27.844360Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-23T02:57:28.001753Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-23T02:57:28.000623Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-23T02:57:27.844663Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["424116\n"]}],"source":["f_label=open('/kaggle/input/predict-student-performance-from-game-play/train_labels.csv')\n","for i,line in enumerate(f_label):\n","    pass\n","print(i)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6a4f73dc-8759-4714-a68c-fb7577e02a51","_uuid":"0dcde6f2-f76a-43c3-bcf4-86cafa53a529","collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-23T02:57:32.194154Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-23T02:57:32.193747Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-23T02:58:32.055036Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-23T02:58:32.053820Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-23T02:57:32.194121Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["session_id,index,elapsed_time,event_name,name,level,page,room_coor_x,room_coor_y,screen_coor_x,screen_coor_y,hover_duration,text,fqid,room_fqid,text_fqid,fullscreen,hq,music,level_group\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["100%|█████████▉| 26296946/26296947 [00:59<00:00, 440252.50it/s]\n"]},{"data":{"text/plain":["0"]},"execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# 采样一部分行\n","def sample_row():\n","    with open('/kaggle/input/predict-student-performance-from-game-play/train.csv') as f:\n","#         f_label=open('/kaggle/input/predict-student-performance-from-game-play/train_labels.csv')\n","        L=26296947\n","        head=f.readline()\n","#         head_label=f_label.readline()\n","        print(head.strip())\n","        with open('/kaggle/working/train_sample_rows.csv','w') as fw:\n","#             label_fw=open('/kaggle/working/train_label_sample_rows.csv','w')\n","            fw.write(head)\n","#             label_fw.write(head_label)\n","            for line in tqdm(f,total=L):\n","#                 line_label=f_label.readline()\n","                if random.random()<1/5000:\n","                    fw.write(line)\n","#                     label_fw.write(line_label)\n","#         f_label.close()\n","#         label_fw.close()\n","sample_row()\n","gc.collect()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"324b3fbe-302d-482b-9fcb-2d332f8681df","_uuid":"f2486043-4565-48ed-a0e1-0974cd254e4b","collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-23T02:58:50.005748Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-23T02:58:50.005366Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-23T02:58:50.013788Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-23T02:58:50.012913Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-23T02:58:50.005719Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# 采样一部分列\n","# 26296947\n","def sample_column():\n","    with open('/kaggle/input/predict-student-performance-from-game-play/train.csv') as f:\n","        head=f.readline()\n","    #
